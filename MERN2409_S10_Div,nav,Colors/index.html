          the discussions were fruitful and that they covered global and
          regional problems. Following Joe Biden and PM Narendra Modi's meeting
          at the POTUS' residence in Delaware, the Commerce Department said
          Monday it's seeking a ban on the sale of connected and autonomous
          vehicles in the U.S. that are equipped with Chinese and Russian
          software and hardware with the stated goal of protecting national
          security and U.S. drivers.

          which is scheduled ‘close to Ganesh Nimarjanam’. They also stated that
          ‘heavy rains’ created many challenges, hinting at why they didn’t opt
          for an open-air venue. “Even though it didn’t rain today conditions
          wouldn’t have been favourable for an outdoor event to happen even if
          we had planned it,” they wrote. The team also claimed that the turnout
          became ‘uncontrollable’ despite their best efforts. “The massive
          turnout of fans despite our best efforts became uncontrollable as
          barricades were broken due to the overwhelming crowd. For the safety
          of everyone we had to make the tough decision to call off the event.”
